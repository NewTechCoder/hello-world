# hello-world
The Hello World project. This repo is like an introduction to creating git repositories.

I am a Python and C++ programmer. I like to code and I enjoy exploring new technologies. I can even do assembly programming, PLC programming using Ladder Logic, and program microcontrollers. I have a bit of background with Web dev using django and bootstrap. At some point in time I taught myself a bit of Data Science libraries like numpy and pandas. My favourite OS is Arch Linux and recently I am using FreeBSD just to get the hang of the Unix philosophy. I love the terminal, and at first I used the Bash shell then used the Zsh now I am learning the Fish shell but my favorite shell is the zsh! My text editor of choice is the VI editor.
